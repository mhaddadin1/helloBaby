# Hello Baby

As new parents, we manually kept track of our baby's feedings to make sure our son was eating often / enough. Tired, and with many other things to keep track of, we started looking for a baby feeding tracker app. Sadly, we ended our search defeated by the available options; they were difficult to learn and use, had limited or no ways to review our baby's feedings, and in some cases were so packed full of stuff that we didn't know where to start.

With out desire to focus on caring for our baby and to avoid the hassle of the available apps, we began working on our solution. A we worked on our solution, we made sure to focus on the previous pain points that we experienced -- our solution needed to be easy to use, give us the statistics that we needed to better care for our baby, and not break the bank.

I am excited to share our new baby to help you as well -- Hello Baby!
